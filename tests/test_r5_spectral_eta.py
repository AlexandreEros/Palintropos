"""R-5 regression tests: absolute vorticity must be built in spectral space.

Locks the fix for docs/KNOWN_RISKS.md R-5: the production tendency used to compute
eta = transform(inv_transform(zeta) + f_grid), round-tripping the state through
the inexact transform every evaluation. Because f is a single huge (1,0) mode
(~48x ||zeta|| for Earth-like rotation at the two-vortices amplitude), the
transform's ~0.85% leakage of f injected coefficient errors of ~12% of ||zeta||
into eta on every call (see tests/audit_r5_mechanism.py). Measured effect at
res4/l21, rotating two-vortices: 0.5-day energy drift +1.1e-2 (old) vs +3.5e-5
(fixed) — ~300x. Long-horizon drift is only partly due to R-5 (12-day: -7.3%
old vs -4.6% fixed); the remainder tracks the resolved cascade hitting the
truncation (R-3), not the eta construction.

On the parent commit (0b6c135) the marked tests fail; on this branch they pass.

    Design note (replaces a single-endpoint check on a review recommendation):
    a single step count is a poor R-5 discriminator because the old code's
    energy trajectory oscillates through zero — initial +1.13e-2 spike at
    step 5, back through zero near step 9, then negative growth. Picking any
    step near a crossing gives spurious agreement (2x separation at step 20).
    Integrated absolute drift is sign-invariant and captures the transient
    regardless of where it happens to land.

    Threshold 5e-3 sits 2.9x above the measured branch value (margin against
    hardware jitter) and 6.8x below the measured parent value (regression
    discrimination). FAILS ON PARENT.

    Isolation note (added when the R-3 fine product landed): this test targets
    R-5 (the eta construction), so it pins the nonlinear-product path to the
    historical "coarse" quadrature. Otherwise the R-3 fine product would also
    enter: on the two_vortices IC, nonlinear transfer interacts with the l=14
    tendency cutoff while the state retains modes through l=21, so the scheme
    is not an invariant-conserving Galerkin truncation (neither of the l<=14
    nor of the l<=21 system) and carries no conservation guarantee for this
    energy exchange; the fine quadrature represents that transfer more
    accurately, which raises integ5 to 6.7e-3. This is an IC-specific
    truncation-mismatch effect with no relation to the eta round trip this
    test guards. Holding product_quadrature='coarse' keeps exactly one
    variable (eta construction) in play.
