## S1 — Invalidates simulation results

### R-1. The Jacobian used by the BVE tendency computes −cos φ·J(ψ,η) instead of J(ψ,η)  — ✅ FIXED (branch `fix/s1-jacobian-and-envelope`)

`SpectralOperators.jacobian_pseudospectral`
([spectral_operators.py:344](../src/tropoi/numerics/spectral_operators.py)) forms

```
J_code = (a_λ·(sinθ b_θ) − (sinθ a_θ)·b_λ) / (R² cos φ)
```

Since `sinθ ∂/∂θ = −cos φ ∂/∂φ`, this equals `−cos φ · J(a,b)`: the correct expression needs
division by cos²φ and the opposite sign (equivalently: `(sinθa_θ·b_λ − a_λ·sinθb_θ)/(R²cos²φ)`).
`BarotropicVorticity.tendency` then applies `transform(−J_code)`, so the advection term
integrated is **`+cos φ · J(ψ, ζ+f)` instead of `−J(ψ, ζ+f)`** — reversed sign with a
spurious latitude-dependent amplitude.

**[measured]** Solid-body streamfunction advecting single modes Y₃², Y₅³, Y₈⁴: ratio of
computed to analytic `(u·∇q)_lm` = **−0.805, −0.791, −0.761** (should be +1.000). The
velocity-form operator `advect_scalar_by_streamfunction` on the same inputs gives
**+1.0000, +1.0000, +1.0009** — i.e. a correct advection operator already exists in the
codebase but is not the one used.

Consequences: Rossby-wave propagation direction is reversed; vortex mutual advection is
reversed and latitude-weighted; **every figure in `out/` and every qualitative conclusion
drawn from runs to date does not depict solutions of the barotropic vorticity equation.**

Remediation (Stage A prerequisite): make `tendency` use the velocity form
(`advect_scalar_by_streamfunction(ψ_lm, η_lm)`, verified correct), or fix the Jacobian to
`(sinθa_θ·b_λ − a_λ·sinθb_θ)/(R² cos²φ)`, then lock with the solid-body and single-mode
Rossby tests (VALIDATION_PLAN A-4, A-5).

**Fix applied**: `jacobian_pseudospectral` corrected in-place to
`(a_sinth·b_lam − a_lam·b_sinth)/cos²φ`. **[measured, post-fix]** solid-body advection of
Y₃², Y₅³, Y₈⁴, Y₁₂⁶ now recovers the analytic `i m ω` to within 5e−3 (worst 2.9e−3 at l=12,
a quadrature effect that shrinks with resolution); it agrees with the independent
`advect_scalar_by_streamfunction` path to <1e−3; `J(a,a)=0` to machine zero; `∮J(a,b)dΩ≈0`.
Locked by `tests/test_spectral_operators.py`.

### R-2. Default configuration (l_max=45 on a resolution-4 grid) is unsupported by the transform  — ✅ FIXED (branch `fix/s1-jacobian-and-envelope`)

The CLI default pairs 1081 basis functions with 2562 points (2.4 points per basis
function) using Voronoi weights. **[measured]** analysis∘synthesis round trip: diagonal
error up to **7.1 %** and spurious-coefficient leakage RMS up to **30 %** at l = 45;
Gram-matrix off-diagonals reach 0.099. At res 5 (9.5 pts/basis) the same l_max is fine
(≤0.1 % / ≤1 %). Because the tendency round-trips the state through the transform on every
evaluation (see R-5), the defaults produce massive spurious dissipation:
**[measured]** 2.5 % kinetic-energy loss in 12 simulated hours with ν = 0.

Remediation: enforce/validate an operating envelope (e.g. `n_points ≥ 6·n_basis`, i.e.
l_max ≤ ~27 at res 4, ~57 at res 5) at construction time; change the CLI defaults; document
the envelope from the A-1 test matrix.

**Fix applied**: `GeodesicSphericalHarmonics` now emits a `UserWarning` (with the largest
safe l_max) whenever `n_points < 6·n_basis`; the `psx-bve` default changed from
(l_max 45, res 4) → (l_max 21, res 4), i.e. ~10 pts/basis. The 6× threshold is a soft guard,
not a hard error, so existing workflows are not broken. The authoritative envelope table is
still owed by VALIDATION_PLAN A-1. Locked by `tests/test_spectral_operators.py`
(warns at l_max 45, silent at l_max 15).

## S2 — Materially degrades results

### R-3. "Dealiasing" is truncation-only and does not dealias  — ✅ FIXED (branch `fix/r3-fine-product-grid`)

The 2/3-rule zeroing in `jacobian_pseudospectral`/`advect_scalar_by_streamfunction` is
applied *after* analyzing the product on the same point set. With inexact quadrature there
is no exact-integration grid, so aliased energy folds into retained modes before the
truncation; the m-truncation line is redundant (m ≤ l already). Aliasing error is
unquantified. (VALIDATION_PLAN A-8 defines the diagnostic.)

**Characterized** (branch `char/r3-product-aliasing`, `tests/audit_r3_product.py`;
RH4, l_max 21, ν = 0, 5 days, fixed dt/N across variants). Factorized variants:
A = production (truncate-inside + extra round trip), B = truncate-once spectrally,
C = no truncation, D = product synthesized/analyzed on the res-(r+1) point set at the
same l_max. **[measured] 5-day energy drift at res 4: A −2.64e−3, B −2.84e−3,
C −2.29e−3, D −4.46e−4.** So: the truncation (B↔C) and the extra round trip (A↔B)
each move the drift by ≲20 %, while fixing the *product-analysis quadrature* (D)
cuts it 6×; res-5-native B (−3.78e−4) ≈ res-4 D — the floor is set by points-per-
product-bandwidth, full stop. The dominant defect operation is **the forward analysis
of the pointwise Jacobian product on the coarse point set**: a product of two l ≤ 21
fields carries content to l ≈ 43, whose analysis against the retained l ≤ 14 modes
requires quadrature exactness far beyond what 2562 Voronoi-weighted points provide;
the aliasing lands in-band *before* truncation, which is why truncating harder cannot
help. Consistent evidence: instantaneous discrete dE/dt at t0 (−4.4e−4/day, variant A)
time-integrates to the observed 5-day drift; conservation error is strongly
grid-orientation-dependent (tilt 0°/30°/60°: −2.6e−3 / −1.1e−2 / **+1.7e−2**, sign
flip), as expected for quadrature error and not for isotropic-in-l truncation error.
At res 5 the quadrature term shrinks ~6× and the extra round trip (A↔B) becomes the
next visible contributor (−7.2e−4 vs −3.8e−4).

**Smallest falsifiable repair** (pre-registered before implementation): promote variant D
to production — evaluate the nonlinear product on a resolution-(r+1) co-grid at the same
l_max (synthesize the four derivative fields on fine points, multiply, analyze with fine
weights, truncate spectrally, return spectral — which also removes the extra round trip).
State, linear operators, truncation level, and time stepping unchanged. Pre-registered
predictions: (P1) res4/l21 RH4 5-day E drift −2.64e−3 → −4.5e−4 (±20 %); (P2) t0 production
rate → ≈ −6e−5/day; (P3) tilt-60° drift magnitude shrinks by ≥3×. Measured cost ~3.5×
tendency at res 4.

**Fix applied** (`fix/r3-fine-product-grid`): `SpectralOperators(..., product_quadrature=
"fine")` builds one reusable resolution-(r+1) product grid + SH evaluator at init;
`jacobian_pseudospectral(..., return_spectral=True)` evaluates the derivative fields on
those points, forms the product, analyzes with the fine quadrature, truncates once, and
returns coefficients; the tendency consumes them directly. `Planet.generate` defaults to
`"fine"`; `"coarse"` retains the historical path for A/B tests. **Verification (production
path, res4/l21, RH4 5-day):**

  P1 ✅ tilt-0 E drift −4.455e−4 (in band; 6.4× better than coarse; = variant D exactly)
  P2 ✅ t0 production rate −6.1e−5/day (test `test_prediction_p2_t0_production_rate`)
  P3 ❌ **refuted as worded** and corrected below.

**Attribution correction (this fix supersedes the characterization's single-cause story).**
Decomposing the fix into its two parts — round-trip removal (A→B) and fine quadrature
(B→D) — across RH4 orientations reveals they dominate in *different* regimes:

    tilt   A coarse+RT   B coarse+spec   D fine+spec (prod)
      0°    −2.64e−3      −2.84e−3        −4.46e−4     ← fine quadrature does the work (6.4×)
     30°    −1.11e−2      −1.03e−2        −9.69e−3     ← neither helps much (truncation floor)
     60°    +1.75e−2      +5.41e−4        −9.26e−4     ← round-trip removal does the work (32×)

So the characterization's "the product-analysis quadrature is *the* dominant defect" holds
**on-axis only**; off-axis the extra synthesis/re-analysis round trip is a separate,
larger, strongly orientation-dependent error (it was invisible in the characterization
because the tilt sweep there ran variant A alone). P3 fails because it credited the fine
*quadrature* with the tilt-60 gain; the gain is real (fix as a whole cuts tilt-60 19×,
+1.75e−2 → −9.26e−4) but comes from the round-trip removal — and the fine quadrature
slightly *worsens* the (non-solution) tilt-60 flow. The fix is beneficial at every
orientation (6.4× / 1.1× / 19×) and never harmful, so it stands; both components are
warranted. **Remaining limitation:** tilt-30 barely improves. The reason is structural:
the tendency is truncated at l = 14 (2/3 rule) while the prognostic state retains modes
through l = 21, so the evolved system is **not an invariant-conserving Galerkin
truncation** of either the l ≤ 14 or the l ≤ 21 system — nonlinear transfer into the
cutoff band l ∈ (14, 21] has no conservation guarantee, and flows that drive such
transfer (tilt-30 RH4, two_vortices filamentation) drift regardless of product-quadrature
quality. Closing that requires a consistent truncation/state treatment (e.g. evolve the
state at the cut, or add scale-selective dissipation across it) — a separate design
decision, out of R-3 scope. Memory note: `"fine"` builds a res-(r+1) grid at init (res 5
co-grid ≈ 160 MB at l_max 21; res 6 co-grid for a res-5 state ≈ 1.3 GB — set `"coarse"`
there).

### R-4. Advective CFL step was fixed from the initial state — ✅ FIXED for the advective condition (state-adaptive)

**Original defect:** `run_bve` computed `dt = 0.5·min_edge/max|u₀|` *once* and reused that
ceiling for the whole run (commit 8666138 called this "adaptive time-stepping"; it was not).
**[measured]** max speed grew 25.4 → 37.5 m/s in a 12 h default run with dt unchanged.

**Fix applied:** the advective CFL ceiling is now recomputed from **every accepted state**.
The runner forms the first ceiling from the initial diagnostics row, advances one accepted
RK4 step, reads that state's `max_speed_ms` from the diagnostics record it already writes,
and recomputes the ceiling for the next step — genuine state-dependent advective CFL
stepping. Structure:

- `advective_cfl_timestep(length_scale, max_speed, *, cfl_number=0.5, fallback=600.0)` in
  [config.py](../src/tropoi/run/bve/config.py) is the sole ceiling arithmetic
  (validates NaN/inf/negative inputs and non-finite/non-positive results; 600 s fallback
  for a missing length scale or a motionless state).
- `IntegrationScheduler.next_event(dt_cfl)` replaces the precomputed fixed-ceiling plan: it
  emits one `store`/`step` event at a time using the *current* ceiling, so the recomputed
  ceiling reaches the very next step. `integration_plan(...)` remains as a constant-ceiling
  compatibility/test helper. Snapshot- and `t_end`-landing clips are unchanged; the explicit
  floating-point stagnation abort is retained.
- The diagnostics velocity reconstruction is *reused*, not duplicated: the runner performs
  no second streamfunction inversion (locked by
  `tests/integration/test_bve_runner.py::test_runner_reuses_diagnostics_velocity_no_duplicate_reconstruction`).

Covered by `tests/cli/test_schedules.py` (incremental count/interval scheduling, constant-
ceiling compatibility, CFL-helper validation) and
`tests/integration/test_bve_controller.py` (the speed after accepted step *n* sets the
ceiling for step *n+1*).

**Still open (explicitly out of this fix's scope):**

- This controls **only the advective CFL condition**. RK4 stability for the explicit `ν∇²`
  diffusion term is still not checked. No instability was observed in short audit runs, but
  that margin remains uncontrolled.
- The CFL length scale still follows the mesh edge, not the spectral resolution
  `2πR/l_max` that is the natural length for a spectral method.
- This is not embedded-error (RK45) adaptivity and no timestep-growth limiter was added
  (none was shown to be needed). No conservation/stability improvement is claimed here — only
  the ceiling policy changed; no reproducible numerical comparison was run for this change.

### R-5. Inviscid invariants drift at O(1 %)/day; state round-trips through a lossy transform every tendency call  — ✅ FIXED (branch `fix/r5-spectral-absolute-vorticity`)

`tendency` synthesizes ζ to the grid, adds f, and re-analyzes — 1 lossy round trip per
evaluation, 4 per RK4 step — although `f_lm` is a constant (a single (1,0) coefficient)
that could be added in spectral space. **[measured]** ν = 0, res 4 / l_max 20, 60 steps
(≈6 days): energy −2.4 %, enstrophy −1.4 % (circulation pinned to ~0 by construction).
For a correctly dealiased spectral BVE these should be at time-integration error levels.
No invariant is monitored during runs.

**Fix applied** (`89985aa`): η = ζ + f_lm built in spectral space; f_lm is the exact
(1,0) coefficient `2Ω·sqrt(4π/3)`; the state is never synthesized/re-analyzed in the
tendency. Mechanism quantified (`tests/audit_r5_mechanism.py`, res 4 / l_max 21,
two-vortices IC, Ω = 2π/86400):

    a₁₀            = 2.977e-04       (analytic, matches transform to 9e-16)
    ‖leakage‖₂     = 2.525e-06       ← what R-5 removes
    ‖ζ‖₂           = 2.182e-05
    ‖leakage‖₂/a₁₀ = 8.5e-3          (the "0.85 %" number: leakage relative to f itself)
    ‖leakage‖₂/‖ζ‖₂= 11.6 %          (measured, directly reported by audit)
    a₁₀/‖ζ‖₂       = 13.6            (correct scale factor from f-relative to ζ-relative)
    ‖ζ-round-trip‖₂/‖ζ‖₂ = 0.93 %    (the second, smaller round-trip R-5 also removes)

so f-leakage swamps the ζ round-trip by 12×. The peak-vs-peak ratio a₁₀/max|ζ_{lm}| ≈ 48
is a separate quantity — useful for intuition about how much f dwarfs ζ, but it does *not*
multiply with the 0.85 % leakage; the L2 factor 13.6 does. The 12 % figure is measured
directly, not derived from the peak ratio.
**[measured, 10-day rotating baseline res4/l21]** absolute-enstrophy drift
−7.9e−3 → **−3.6e−4** (22×); l=1 energy loss −18.8 % → −5.7 %; 0.5-day energy drift
+1.1e−2 → +3.5e−5 (~300×); total 10-day energy drift −6.4 % → **−3.8 %**; wall time
−21 % (8 fwd + 20 inv transforms per RK4 step, was 12 + 24). Locked by
`tests/test_r5_spectral_eta.py` (verified failing on parent `0b6c135`).

**Attribution corrections recorded for honesty:** (i) the earlier claim that the f
round trip explained the *entire* rotating energy loss was wrong — the non-rotating
"control" behind it is a quasi-steady state (axisymmetric vortices ~120° apart;
tendency ~1e−13), i.e. it has no dynamics to lose energy; (ii) the falsifiable
prediction "~0.01 % rotating drift after R-5" is **refuted** — the remaining −3.8 %/10 d
is not the η construction (instantaneous dE/dt is a null for both constructions since
∮ψJ(ψ,η)dA = 0 for any η; the damage was trajectory-level). Leading suspects for the
remainder: truncation-only dealiasing (R-3) acting on the β-driven cascade, product-
analysis quadrature error, and time-truncation error (the advective step is now
state-adaptive per R-4, but RK4 temporal error and the uncontrolled `ν∇²` stability margin
remain) — attribution is the next resolution/step sweep, not yet established.

### R-6. `step_leapfrog` is dead code that crashes if called

It passes raw coefficient arrays to `vorticity_to_streamfunction`, which asserts
`isinstance(vrt_state, BarotropicState)` → `AssertionError` on first use. Only `rk4_step`
is actually used. Delete or fix.

### R-7. Legacy lat–lon transform drops the last longitude panel (systematic 1/n_lon bias)

`LatLonSphericalHarmonics` + `simpson_2d`: longitudes are built with `endpoint=False`
(period missing its final panel) while Simpson's rule integrates the open interval; the
even-n fallback weights in `simpson_2d` are also incorrect. **[measured]** for f = 1 on a
33×65 grid: a₀₀ = 3.4904 vs √(4π) = 3.5449 — a deficit of exactly 1/65 — plus spurious
coefficients up to 3e−2. This engine is the *reference* in `consistency_test.py` and
`test_spherical_harmonics_compare.py`, so those comparisons are anchored to a biased
baseline (hence the 60 % tolerance, see R-8). The geodesic engine is *more* accurate than
the "truth" it is compared against.

### R-8. The test suite cannot catch regressions

- `test_orthogonality.py` has **no assertions** (prints diagnostics, returns a tuple —
  pytest even warns about the non-None return).
- `test_spherical_harmonics_compare.py` asserts relative L2 < **0.6** on low-degree
  coefficients only.
- `test_grid_interpolation.py` asserts RMSE < 0.2 for an O(1) field.
- `consistency_test.py` executes at import (module-level code), is not collected, and its
  0.1 "success threshold" is a print, not an assert.
- Nothing tests operators, the Jacobian, the model tendency, or conservation — which is how
  R-1 survived. All 3 collected tests pass **[measured]** while the dynamical core is wrong.

## S3 — Correctness/robustness hazards

### R-9. CLI default `--day-hours inf` silently yields a non-rotating planet

`PlanetaryParameters` accepts it (Ω = 0, oblateness 0), so the flagship "barotropic
vorticity on a rotating sphere" demo runs with f = 0 unless the user passes `--day-hours`.
Make rotation explicit, or default to 24 h.

### R-10. Diffusion uses the mutated l = 0 eigenvalue

`BarotropicVorticity.__init__` overwrites `laplacian_eig[0] = +1/R²`; the diffusion term
`ν·λ_l·ζ_lm` therefore *amplifies* the l = 0 mode. Currently masked by the hard-zeroing of
the l = 0 tendency row — a silent coupling between two hacks. Keep the eigenvalue array
physical and special-case the inversion instead. Related: `SpectralOperators.inv_laplacian`
and `vorticity_to_streamfunction` treat the l = 0 mode differently (1/R² vs zeroed).

### R-11. `d_lambda_coeffs` mutates shared precomputed state on every call

`self._im_m_over_R` is initialized with `[0,0] = 1.0` "to avoid division by zero", then the
*getter* sets `[0,0] = 0.0` in place each call. Anything reading the buffer before the
first call sees the wrong value; the pattern is also a thread-safety hazard. Precompute the
final values once.

### R-12. Unclamped `1/cos φ` divisions rely on a hidden 0.01-rad grid rotation

`grad_from_scalar` divides by `grid.coslat` with no floor (velocity path floors at 1e−6,
Jacobian at 1e−8). Nothing prevents a future grid (or a user-supplied point set with a point
at a pole) from producing Inf/NaN. The icosahedron "anti-singularity" rotation is the only
protection, and it is undocumented.

### R-13. Optimized-weight cache key omits radius and grid orientation

`sh_weights_res{r}_lmax{L}.pkl` verifies `n_points` and basis-id only. Weights computed for
one radius are valid solid-angle weights for another (they are normalized), so this is
currently benign, but any change to the anti-singularity rotation or subdivision scheme
would silently reuse stale caches. Include a content hash of the point set.

### R-14. Diagnostics mislabeled and inconsistent

`VorticityViewer`: "Total Kinetic Energy (K) … J/kg" is actually ∫½|u|²dA (m⁴ s⁻², per unit
density); "RMS Vorticity (Enstrophy)" is RMS ζ, not enstrophy ½∫ζ²dA; area weights use
`equatorial_radius` while the dynamics use the volumetric mean `params.radius`; plots
render on a −89…89° remapped lat-lon grid (pole rows extrapolated by `griddata`).

### R-15. GPU-only, Windows-TDR-exposed execution

No CPU fallback exists (module-scope `import cupy` everywhere), so: no CI without a GPU
runner, no CPU/GPU cross-validation, and on Windows display GPUs long kernels are killed by
the WDDM watchdog — **[observed]** `cudaErrorLaunchTimeout` during an audit Gram-matrix
computation at res 5. Pin of `cupy-cuda11x` also ties the project to CUDA 11.

---

## S4 — Hygiene and documentation

### R-16. Latent/duplicated numerical machinery

`DifferentialOperatorsSpherical` (local least-squares gradients + a **graph Laplacian
`D − W`, which is not a consistent surface-Laplacian discretization**) is constructed
lazily but never called by any live path. `sh_matrix_real.cu` is never loaded.
`LatLonSphericalHarmonics` survives only as a (biased, R-7) test baseline. Either quarantine
these clearly as experimental or delete them.

### R-17. Assorted hygiene

- Empty modules: `run/bve/config.py`, `run/bve/io.py`, `physics/gravity.py`,
  `viz/spectra.py`, `viz/__init__.py`.
- `.bak` files inside the package (`sh_matrixcu.bak`, `fast_geodesic_shpy.bak`).
- Large commented-out blocks (old `Planet.generate`, old `SpectralOperators`).
- `Planet.generate` computes `radial_distance` twice; runs terrain synthesis even for BVE
  runs; default terrain RMS is 0.1 % of the radius (6.4 km) — decorative but odd.
- `_random_low_l` writes coefficients into invalid m > l slots (harmlessly ignored) and
  non-zero imaginary parts on m = 0 (silently dropped by synthesis).
- `pyproject.toml` declares `dependencies = []` ("dependency hell" comment) while the
  package hard-requires numpy/scipy/cupy/matplotlib — `pip install palintropos`
  would produce a broken install; `requirements.txt` is the real manifest.
- Typo `ovarall_step` (runner); docstrings claiming "real basis" where the basis is
  complex (`terrain_spectral`, `LatLonSphericalHarmonics.inv_transform`); stale
  colatitude comment on the Coriolis setup.
- README documents only setup and two CLI examples; no statement of equations, status, or
  limitations.

## What was *checked and found sound* (for balance)

- Basis normalization/orthogonality at adequate sampling (Gram ≈ I to ~1e−3 with Voronoi
  weights at ≥9 pts/basis; machine-exact recovery of Y₀⁰, Y₁⁰ coefficients).
- Laplacian / inverse-Laplacian eigenvalue treatment (l ≥ 1), zonal derivative, the
  `sinθ ∂θ` recurrence (re-derived analytically and spot-checked), velocity-from-ψ and
  scalar-gradient operators (machine precision on solid-body fields **[measured]**),
  the velocity-form advection operator, circulation pinning, RK4 arithmetic,
  RH4 initial-condition formula (matches the closed form for ζ = ∇²ψ/… with (R²+3R+2) = 30
  at R = 4), Condon–Shortley handling after the recorded double-phase fix.
