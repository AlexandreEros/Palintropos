# Williamson test case 5 — Aeolus vs the MRI-JMA reference (2026-07-30)

> **Project name:** Aeolus is now Palintropos (distribution `palintropos`,
> import package `tropoi`, command `tropoi`). The historical model name,
> pinned commits, artifact filenames, and the `aeolus run swe` command lines
> below are retained for provenance: they record what was actually executed

**Status: accepted.** Aeolus integrates the corrected canonical Williamson-5
initial-value problem, passes the day-zero physical contract at T42 and T63,
completes 15 simulated days at both resolutions with excellent mass and energy
conservation, and tracks a published high-resolution reference model to
sub-metre free-surface RMS at day 0 and a few metres at day 15.

This is a **numerical-model intercomparison**, not a comparison against an
analytic truth solution: Williamson case 5 has no closed-form solution, so the
reference is another model's high-resolution output, itself carrying
discretization error. The numbers below bound the *difference between two
models*, not Aeolus's error.

## 1. Benchmark and reference

**Benchmark.** Williamson et al. (1992) test case 5 — zonal flow
`u = u0 cos(lat)`, `u0 = 20 m/s`, over the canonical isolated **conical**
mountain (`hs0 = 2000 m`, `R0 = pi/9`, centred 30°N / 90°W), with the case-2
height field prescribed as the **free surface**, `eta = h0 - (C/g) sin^2(lat)`,
`h0 = 5960 m`, `C = a*Omega*u0 + u0^2/2`. Aeolus's implementation, constants,
and the cone's coordinate-plane distance convention are documented in
[SHALLOW_WATER.md](../SHALLOW_WATER.md).

**Reference.** The Meteorological Research Institute / Japan Meteorological

The archived variable `h` was **established to be the free-surface height**
(not the layer depth) before any comparison was run: it matches the case-2
balanced surface at day 0 to `2.4e-4 m`, and the model's own logged global mean
mass equals `mean(h - h_s)` to `4e-4 m`. That determination — and the discovery
that Aeolus's pre-2026-07-29 initial condition prescribed the same field as
*thickness*, i.e. a physically different initial-value problem — is recorded in
[notebooks/W5_MRI_SEMANTIC_AUDIT.md](../../notebooks/W5_MRI_SEMANTIC_AUDIT.md).
The correction is commit
[`668e6c9a`](https://github.com/AlexandreEros/Palintropos/commit/668e6c9a5735b2d7200dcc121eb0f7c40450ae08),
*fix(swe): canonicalize Williamson-5 initial state*.

**Field contract.** Both sides are reduced to the same physical fields on the
same Gauss–Legendre grids before any metric is computed; nothing is inferred
from numerical agreement.

```
MRI:     free_surface_height = archived h
         layer_depth         = h - topography_height   (analytic cone)
Aeolus:  layer_depth         = (Phi0 + phi) / g
         free_surface_height = (Phi0 + phi + phi_s) / g
         topography_height   = phi_s / g               (band-limited cone)
```

Metrics are area-weighted with the Gauss–Legendre quadrature weights: `wRMS` is
the weighted root-mean-square difference, `rel L2` the weighted relative L2 norm
against the reference field, and `max abs` the pointwise maximum absolute
difference.

## 2. Aeolus configuration

Both runs use the **exact same clean commit** and differ only in resolution.

Full manifests:
[aeolus_t42_run_manifest.json](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/aeolus_t42_run_manifest.json),
[aeolus_t63_run_manifest.json](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/aeolus_t63_run_manifest.json).

## 3. Day-zero physical contract

Tolerances were **declared before** the comparison and gate the 15-day runs: the
notebook refuses to start an integration unless the contract passes.

| Quantity | Tolerance | T42 | T63 |
|---|---|---|---|
| wind `max abs` | `< 0.05 m/s` | `2.60e-05` | `2.72e-05` |
| height `max abs` | `< 5.0 m` | `0.0110` | `0.00652` |
| height `rel L2` | `< 5.0e-4` | `1.44e-06` | `8.37e-07` |

**Verdict: passed at both resolutions** (`contract_passed: true`), by three to
four orders of magnitude on every channel. Full record:
[day0_contract.json](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/day0_contract.json).

The residual free-surface offset (`-0.011 m` at T42, `+0.0065 m` at T63) is the
terrain-monopole quadrature error of the band-limited cone, independently
predicted in `SHALLOW_WATER.md` as `-0.0086 m` at `l_max=42` and `+0.0041 m` at
`l_max=63` — same sign, same order.

The initial meridional wind agrees to `2e-17 m/s`: both models start from
`v = 0` to floating-point roundoff.

![Day-zero T42 comparison](williamson_5/figures/compare_t42_day00.png)

*Day 0, T42. Rows: free surface, layer depth, wind speed; columns: MRI, Aeolus,
signed difference. The free-surface and wind differences are at the `1e-2 m` and
`1e-5 m/s` level. The only visible structure is the ringing confined to the cone
in the layer-depth difference — Gibbs oscillation of the band-limited conical
terrain, not a dynamical discrepancy.*

## 4. Fifteen-day completion and conservation

Both runs reached `t = 1 296 000 s` (15 days) with `status: completed` and no
non-finite state. Diagnostics are computed at every accepted step; the values
below are derived from the per-step `diagnostics/timeseries.csv` in each capsule
([conservation_summary.json](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/conservation_summary.json)).

| Diagnostic | T42 | T63 |
|---|---|---|
| Accepted steps | 2363 | 3535 |
| Relative **mass** drift (15 d) | `0.0` (bit-identical) | `0.0` (bit-identical) |
| Relative mass span over run | `0.0` | `0.0` |
| Relative **energy** drift (15 d) | `+3.36e-07` | `-7.92e-07` |
| Relative energy span over run | `4.56e-07` | `7.94e-07` |
| Timestep range | 109.8 – 587.6 s | 134.5 – 392.8 s |
| Maximum wind over run | `42.66 m/s` | `42.76 m/s` |
| Minimum layer depth over run | `3825.2 m` | `3761.5 m` |

Total mass is conserved to the last bit of the `float64` accumulator over
thousands of steps, and total energy drifts by under one part in `10^6` on an
**inviscid** run with no hyperdiffusion and no numerical damping of any kind.

### 4.1 Spectral complexity of the T63 snapshots

The conservation figures above say the run holds its invariants; they say
nothing about how much *structure* the flow has acquired. The holistic T63
figure
([overview_2026-07-30.png](../runs/20260730T011700Z_williamson5_rot23p93h_r4_l63_dt120h_45406d82_668e6c9a/assets/overview_2026-07-30.png),
an asset of the published run, produced by
[williamson_5/plot_swe_holistic.py](williamson_5/plot_swe_holistic.py))
therefore carries a small per-snapshot spectral block alongside the drifts.
Everything in it comes from artifacts already saved by the canonical T63 run —
`swe_coeffs.npy`, `swe_snapshot_times.npy` and `diagnostics/timeseries.csv` in
the capsule, plus the day-0/5/10/15 `npz` field package. Nothing is re-run and
nothing is approximated.

**Definition.** The velocity is decomposed the way the solver already carries
it — rotational (streamfunction `psi`) plus divergent (velocity potential
`chi`), i.e. the vector-spherical-harmonic split — never by treating the raw
lat-lon `u` and `v` as two independent scalar fields. With
`psi_lm = -R^2 zeta_lm/(l(l+1))`, `chi_lm = -R^2 delta_lm/(l(l+1))`, and the
two parts orthogonal in the energy integral over a closed surface, the modal
kinetic energy and its normalized distribution are

```
E(l,m) = (R^4/2) * [P_zeta(l,m) + P_delta(l,m)] / (l(l+1)),  l >= 1
E(0,m) = 0                                  (the l=0 mode carries no velocity)
p(l,m) = E(l,m) / sum E(l,m)                (nonnegative, sums to 1)
```

`P` is the repository's own `_mode_power` convention for the `m >= 0` storage
layout (`|c|^2` for `m = 0`, `2|c|^2` for `m > 0`), so each stored mode already
carries the power of its full `+/-m` conjugate pair and the sum runs over
`0 <= m <= l`. The three reported measures are

```
<l>   = sum l * p(l,m)          power-weighted mean degree
<|m|> = sum |m| * p(l,m)        power-weighted mean zonal wavenumber
S     = -sum p ln p             Shannon entropy of p; zero-power modes are
                                excluded, contributing exactly 0
N_eff = exp(S)                  effective number of occupied modes
```

`S` is the Shannon entropy **of a modal energy distribution**. It is not a
thermodynamic entropy and is not a measure of "information content". The figure
reports the more legible `N_eff`; `S` is printed to stdout by the script. `R`
cancels in `p`, so all three measures are independent of the planetary radius.

**Verification.** The script asserts `sum E(l,m)` against the Gauss-Legendre
grid quadrature of `0.5 * integral |u|^2 dA` taken from the saved `u`/`v`
fields, to `1e-11` relative (measured agreement is `~2e-15`). That single check
pins the normalization, the `m`-doubling, the rotational/divergent split, and
the fact that the coefficient file and the field package describe the same run.

| Day | mass drift | energy drift | pot. enstrophy drift | `<l>` | `<\|m\|>` | `S` | `N_eff` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | reference | reference | reference | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.0000 | 1.000 |
| 5 | `0.00e+00` | `-4.85e-09` | `+4.91e-08` | 1.563 | 0.467 | 0.6348 | 1.887 |
| 10 | `0.00e+00` | `-1.81e-07` | `-1.46e-06` | 2.149 | 0.884 | 1.1124 | 3.042 |
| 15 | `0.00e+00` | `-7.92e-07` | `-8.52e-06` | 2.663 | 1.208 | 1.4857 | 4.418 |

Day 0 is **exactly** one mode: `p(1,0) = 1.0` bit-for-bit and the divergence
coefficients are identically zero, which is the correct spectral signature of
the `u = u0 cos(lat)` solid-body initial state, and gives `S = 0`, `N_eff = 1`.
Fifteen days of flow over the mountain spread that energy to `<l> = 2.66` and
about 4.4 effective modes while mass stays bit-identical, energy holds to
`8e-07` and potential enstrophy to `9e-06`. The redistribution the maps show
is therefore real dynamics, not a loss of the invariants.

Two smaller corrections in the same pass: the figure's mean speed is now
area-weighted with the Gauss latitude weights rather than a plain grid average
(the plain mean under-weights the tropics where the jet is fastest — 12.80 m/s
against the correct 15.71 m/s at day 0, which reproduces the analytic
`u0*pi/4 = 15.708` for the solid-body state), and potential enstrophy is
reported as drift from day 0 rather than as a bare absolute value that is
constant to four decimal places.

† **The raw `layer_depth` row is terrain-representation-dominated and is not a

At day 15 the free-surface fields agree to a weighted RMS of **5.6 m (T42)** and
**4.7 m (T63)** on a `~5620 m` layer — a relative L2 of `9.9e-4` and `8.3e-4`.
The winds agree to a weighted RMS of `0.44 m/s` and `0.21 m/s` in `u` against
peak winds above `40 m/s`.

![Day-15 T63 comparison](williamson_5/figures/compare_t63_day15.png)

*Day 15, T63. After 15 days of inviscid nonlinear evolution the Rossby wave
train shed by the mountain is reproduced in phase and amplitude; the signed
differences are small-scale and an order of magnitude below the features
themselves.*

![Day-15 T42 comparison](williamson_5/figures/compare_t42_day15.png)

*Day 15, T42. The same structures at the coarser truncation, with visibly larger
small-scale residuals — consistent with the resolution sensitivity in § 6.*

![Day-zero T63 comparison](williamson_5/figures/compare_t63_day00.png)

*Day 0, T63. The terrain-representation ring is roughly halved relative to T42
(`87.4 m` → `36.5 m` peak), matching the drop in the cone projection residual
from `0.025` to `0.012`.*

## 6. Interpretation

**The large raw `layer_depth` maximum difference is terrain representation, not
dynamics.** Aeolus carries the cone as a **band-limited** spectral field; the
reference carries the **analytic** cone evaluated at grid nodes. Writing
`terr = topo_ref - topo_aeolus`, the depth difference decomposes exactly:

```
(h*_aeolus - h*_ref) - terr  ==  eta_aeolus - eta_ref
```

Verified on the canonical snapshot files, this identity holds to `9.1e-13 m` at
every stored day and both resolutions — floating-point roundoff. The static term
`terr` alone reaches `87.38 m` (T42) and `36.48 m` (T63), which is *precisely*
the day-0 raw `layer_depth` maximum (`87.37 m` / `36.49 m`), because at day 0 the
dynamical part is only `0.011 m` / `0.0065 m`. Measured cone peaks on the state
grid: analytic `1930.14 m` / `1922.33 m`; Aeolus band-limited `1842.76 m` /
`1885.84 m`, with Gibbs undershoot to `-19.56 m` / `-13.10 m`.

Consequently:

- **Use the free-surface height `eta` for the dynamical comparison.** The
  terrain-adjusted depth difference is *identically* the free-surface
  difference, so `eta` already is the terrain-adjusted measure — the day-zero
  contract's `layer_depth_minus_terrain_repr` row and its `free_surface_height`
  row agree to `1e-12 m`, as the identity requires.
- **The raw depth row stays in the table**, labelled, because hiding a metric
  that looks bad is worse than explaining it.

**This is an intercomparison, not an error against truth.** The reference is
MRI's own discrete solution at `nmax = 958`. Nothing here licenses the claim
that Aeolus "matches truth" or reproduces MRI identically; two models started
from the same initial state on the same benchmark stay close for 15 days.

**No convergence order is claimed.** Two resolutions cannot measure a
convergence rate, and the reference is not an exact solution. The T42 → T63
change is reported as a sensitivity, not a rate.

**Wind agreement improves with resolution more strongly than height agreement.**
At day 15, T42 → T63 reduces the weighted RMS difference by a factor of `2.07`
in `u` and `2.36` in `v`, but only `1.19` in the free surface. This is expected
rather than alarming: the height field is dominated by the large-scale balanced
structure, which is already well resolved at T42, while the winds carry the
fine-scale vorticity filaments that the extra truncation band actually resolves.
It is recorded here as an observation, not a defect, and it does not affect
acceptance.

**Non-blocking future work.** None of the following reopens acceptance:

- decomposing the day-15 difference into phase error, amplitude error, and
  small-scale content across additional resolutions;
- a dissipation-sensitivity study (the runs are deliberately inviscid, and the
  SWE CLI exposes no hyperdiffusion);
- a third truncation, which would be needed before any convergence-rate claim;
- comparing against an additional independent reference model.

## 7. Provenance

**Canonical result identity.** The only canonical W5 result is the T42/T63 pair
recorded in the manifests linked above, all reporting `status: completed`,
`git.commit: 668e6c9a5735b2d7200dcc121eb0f7c40450ae08`, and `git.dirty: false`.
Run IDs (the trailing field is the commit short hash):

```
20260730T011622Z_williamson5_rot23p93h_r4_l42_dt120h_a1f9d0a9_668e6c9a
20260730T011700Z_williamson5_rot23p93h_r4_l63_dt120h_45406d82_668e6c9a
```

**Notebooks.** Two notebooks reproduce the whole chain:

- [notebooks/mri_w5_reference_preparation.ipynb](../../notebooks/mri_w5_reference_preparation.ipynb)
  — CPU; downloads and hash-verifies the MRI archive, establishes the archived
  field semantics, and freezes the reference packages plus a manifest.
- [notebooks/w5_mri_validation_colab.ipynb](../../notebooks/w5_mri_validation_colab.ipynb)
  — GPU; clones Aeolus at the pinned commit and *asserts* the checkout produced
  it, verifies package hashes and the field contract, evaluates the day-zero
  gate, runs the 15-day integrations only if the gate passed, and postprocesses.
  It pins `AEOLUS_COMMIT = "668e6c9a5735b2d7200dcc121eb0f7c40450ae08"`.

*Honest note on notebook provenance.* The version of Notebook B committed at
`668e6c9a` itself still pinned the earlier commit `580c566a`; the pin was
updated in the working copy actually executed. The notebooks tracked here are
those **executed** versions — corrected pin, plus the browser upload/download
transport cells that carried the packages between the two Colab sessions — with
their bulky execution outputs stripped. They therefore differ from the
historical `668e6c9a` copies, and the historical copies are not described as the
executed ones. The authority for what ran is not the notebook in any case: each
run manifest independently records the executable's argv, resolved
configuration, backend and numerics, library versions, GPU model, and the
clean-worktree Git status at execution time.

**External archive.** The full generated evidence — both 15-day run capsules
with their per-step diagnostics CSVs and spectral coefficients, the smoke run,
the day-0/5/10/15 `npz` field packages, all eight comparison figures, and the
MRI reference packages — is mirrored on Drive and deliberately **not** in Git:

<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10RCkvpbkH69rlAp-4SGBT9J9fcn5it1H>

SHA-256 checksums for every external file, including the three upstream MRI
source files, are in
[CHECKSUMS.txt](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/CHECKSUMS.txt). The reference and
result `npz` hashes there are the ones recorded independently at write time
inside
[mri_reference_manifest.json](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/mri_reference_manifest.json)
and [aeolus_t42_COMPLETE.json](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/aeolus_t42_COMPLETE.json)
/ [aeolus_t63_COMPLETE.json](williamson5_mri_2026-07-30/aeolus_t63_COMPLETE.json),
so the archive can be checked against Git without trusting either copy alone.

*Update, 2026-09-25:* the T63 run capsule (1.9 MB) is now also in Git as a
published run:
[docs/runs/20260730T011700Z_williamson5_rot23p93h_r4_l63_dt120h_45406d82_668e6c9a](../runs/README.md).
It is byte-identical to the copy in `w5-mri-canonical-validation.zip` and
carries its own `SHA256SUMS` receipt. The T42 capsule remains on Drive only.

**Superseded material.** Every W5 trajectory, measured envelope, and acceptance
capsule produced before the 2026-07-29 initial-condition correction is
superseded, including the `archive/w5-mri-v2-invalid` branch (`42bcc38c`). Only
the two runs identified above are canonical.
