"""Initial conditions for the shallow-water core.

Each scenario returns a :class:`ShallowWaterState` built *spectrally* (no
grid round trip), so the states are exactly monopole-free and exactly
band-limited. The available scenarios are the minimal set required by the
first shallow-water milestone (see run/swe/config.SWE_SCENARIOS).

Topography-aware construction
-----------------------------
Every scenario — including ``williamson5`` — specifies a velocity field
and a FREE-SURFACE geopotential anomaly ``phi_fs'`` (both monopole-free);
the prognostic thickness perturbation is then

    phi = phi_fs' - phi_s'

where ``phi_s'`` is the mean-removed surface geopotential of the model's
fixed bottom topography (exactly zero for a flat bottom, so every flat-
bottom state is bit-for-bit identical to the historical construction).
This makes each scenario well-defined over terrain: ``rest`` is the exact
lake-at-rest state (constant free surface, zero velocity), and the flowing
scenarios launch their historical wind/free-surface pair over the mountain
(for ``williamson2`` that is a mountain-flow experiment, not the flat-
bottom steady solution). The global-mean thickness is exactly the model's
``mean_depth`` in every case.

Every scenario validates its state before returning, so terrain that
protrudes through the fluid layer fails here — before integration — with
the model's explicit thickness-collapse diagnosis.

    Canonical prescription (Williamson et al. 1992, Sect. 2 defines
    ``h = h* + h_s`` with ``h`` the FREE SURFACE and ``h*`` the depth;
    Sect. 3.5 takes "the wind and height field ... as in case 2, with
    alpha = 0"; full derivation with MRI-JMA cross-checks in
    notebooks/W5_MRI_SEMANTIC_AUDIT.md):

        u   = u0*cos(lat),  v = 0,             u0 = 20 m/s
        eta = h0 - (C/g) sin^2(lat),           C = a*Omega*u0 + u0^2/2
        h*  = eta - h_s                        (cone-shaped depression)

    where ``eta`` is the free-surface height and ``h*`` the fluid-layer
    depth. Translated to the model's variables (``g h* = Phi0 + phi`` with
    the phi monopole pinned to zero, ``phi_s = g h_s``):

        g h* = g*h0 - C sin^2(lat) - phi_s
             = [g*h0 - C/3 - g*mean(h_s)]                (mean -> Phi0)
               + [C*(1/3 - sin^2 lat) - phi_s']          (anomaly -> phi)

    so phi = C*(1/3 - sin^2 lat) - phi_s' — exactly the terrain-aware
    free-surface construction shared by every other scenario — and the
    mean depth resolved by the config layer is
    H = h0 - C/(3g) - mean(h_s) (``W5_MEAN_DEPTH_M``, with the cone mean
    in closed form). The initial free surface Phi0 + phi + phi_s then
    reproduces eta exactly (phi_s' and the terrain monopole cancel), and
    the layer depth carries the canonical cone-shaped bite, band-limited
    at the model truncation like the terrain itself.

    Built exactly in spectral space: zeta = (2*u0/a) sin(lat) is the pure
    (1,0) mode, delta = 0, phi is the (2,0) case-2 mode minus phi_s'. A
    terrain-less model (defensive/testing path only — the config layer
    always pairs williamson5 with its cone) degenerates to the flat
    case-2 pair.

    HISTORY: before 2026-07-29 this scenario prescribed the case-2 field
    as the THICKNESS (no phi_s' compensation), i.e. a free surface RAISED
    over the cone — a physically different initial-value problem from the
    published test case and from the MRI-JMA reference trajectories. The
    semantic audit (notebooks/W5_MRI_SEMANTIC_AUDIT.md) established the
    canonical reading from Williamson (1992) Sect. 2 + 3.5 and the MRI
    archive; regression tests now pin THIS construction.
