    ``snapshot_mode`` selects the execution semantics **explicitly** at the
    runner boundary (the caller states which contract it wants; the runner
    never infers the legacy path from ``snapshot_times is None``):

    * ``"count"`` — the authoritative ``snapshot_times`` schedule is consumed
      with **exact target-time** semantics: every scheduled time (including
      ``t_end`` for N>=1) is landed on exactly, so the stored snapshot times
      and the final diagnostic time equal the requested targets. Guaranteed
      even for deliberately non-aligned durations.
    * ``"interval"`` — historical interval-boundary semantics reconstructed
      from ``dt_snapshots`` (stored at t=0 and each boundary; the final state
      only when the duration is a multiple of the interval; legacy
      ``1e-6 * dt_snapshots`` stopping tolerance). Preserved bit-for-bit.

    When ``snapshot_mode`` is None it is inferred for backward compatibility
    with direct callers (``"count"`` if an explicit ``snapshot_times`` is
    given, else ``"interval"``); the installed ``execute_run`` always passes
    it explicitly. ``plots`` selects which image products to render (subset
    of ``config.PLOT_TYPES``); None renders everything. Field-snapshot
    persistence and per-step numerical diagnostics are independent of
    ``plots``.
