"""Solver-independent run lifecycle: base dir, provenance, status, pointer.

Extracted from ``cli/bve.py::execute_run`` so the BVE and shallow-water
commands share one implementation of the (carefully ordered) run lifecycle:

1. Resolve the output base directory (with the writability fallback).
2. Create the run directory.
3. On --overwrite reuse: clear latest_run.txt if it points at this
   directory, then remove known stale generated artifacts — both *before*
   the manifest is replaced / status set back to 'running'.
4. Write config.json and manifest.json with status='running' (atomically)
   *before* any numerical work.
5. Dispatch the solver callback.
6. On success, rewrite manifest.json with status='completed' (raising if
   that cannot be persisted) and only then publish latest_run.txt.
7. On failure, rewrite manifest.json with status='failed' + a concise error
   record, do NOT publish latest_run.txt, and re-raise. A provenance-
   persistence failure on this path is surfaced, never swallowed.

The solver-specific pieces are injected as callables: ``solver(cfg,
run_dir, run_config)`` runs the heavy numerics, ``clean_artifacts(out_dir)``
removes that solver's stale generated outputs on --overwrite reuse.
