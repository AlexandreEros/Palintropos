"""Initial conditions for the dry primitive-equation core.

Three presets. All are built spectrally on top of
:func:`~tropoi.spatial.states.primitive_equations.isothermal_rest_state`,
so vorticity and divergence are exactly zero and the fields are exactly
band-limited (no grid round trip).

``isothermal_rest``
    Exactly resting, horizontally uniform isothermal atmosphere: zeta = delta
    = 0, T_k = ``temperature`` at every level, p_s = ``surface_pressure``
    everywhere. This is the model's exact-rest state (its tendency is exactly
    zero), used to verify that the runner preserves rest bit-for-bit.

``thermal_wave``
    The resting isothermal state plus a single deterministic degree-2
    temperature perturbation. The perturbation is one real spherical-harmonic
    coefficient placed on the (l, m) = (2, 2) sectoral mode at *every* full
    level (a vertically uniform profile), following the repository's
    real-field coefficient convention (a single real coefficient at
    (l, m>0) synthesizes a valid longitude-varying real field, exactly as the
    shallow-water ``gravity_wave`` preset does). ``thermal_amplitude`` is that
    coefficient's value in kelvin; ~1 K keeps the perturbed temperature
    positive everywhere. Surface pressure stays uniform and the initial winds
    stay zero, so the state is deliberately *unbalanced* — it exists to show
    the PE model launches a smooth, finite response, not a balanced flow.

``orographic_isothermal_rest``
    Analytically balanced resting isothermal atmosphere over the model's
    prescribed surface geopotential Phi_s (zero terrain reduces bitwise to
    ``isothermal_rest``): zeta = delta = 0, T_k = ``temperature`` (T0) at
    every full level, and

        ln(p_s) = ln(p_ref) - Phi_s / (R_d T0)

    with p_ref = ``surface_pressure`` (the surface pressure where Phi_s = 0).
    The relation is applied directly to the spectral coefficients — the
    ln(p_ref) monopole minus ``model.phi_surface_lm / (r_dry * T0)`` — so the
    state derives from the EXACT resolved Phi_s the model integrates with (no
    grid round trip, no independent reconstruction of the terrain). The state
    is horizontally and hydrostatically balanced because grad(Phi_s) +
    R_d T0 grad(ln p_s) = 0 pointwise, so the pressure-gradient terms of the
    momentum tendency cancel analytically.

    The isothermal restriction is a property of this benchmark, not of the
    PE topography support: a resting atmosphere with a horizontally uniform
    NON-isothermal T(sigma) profile over terrain is generally NOT balanced,
    because sigma surfaces cut across pressure surfaces where p_s varies. A
    future exact non-isothermal construction must instead define a
    pressure-coordinate reference profile T_ref(p), hydrostatically derive
    Phi_ref(p), solve Phi_ref(p_s) = Phi_s for the local surface pressure,
    and evaluate T_k = T_ref(sigma_k p_s(lambda, phi)) — a separate
    constructor, deliberately not begun here.
